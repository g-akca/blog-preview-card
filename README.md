## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### Continued development

I want to work on font units and responsive design more.

### Useful resources

- [object-fit - CSS | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - Helped me resize the image and always fill the container without changing the image's aspect ratio (cover).
- [box-shadow - CSS | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - I keep forgetting which values of box-shadow set which effect, so this page was helpful.
